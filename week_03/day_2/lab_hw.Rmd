**Duration - 120 minutes**  

In these practice questions you'll return again to the `omni_pool` database, so re-establish your connection in `DBeaver` if it has lapsed.

**Submission**

When answering these questions, please save your `SQL` script in `DBeaver`, copy it over to your homework repo and then add, commit and push that for submission tonight. Please add section and question numbers as `SQL` comments, like so:

# MVP 

<br>

**Question 1.**\
<ul>
(a). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of `teams`.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>  
We only want employees who are also in the teams table. So which type of join should we use? 
</details>

<br>

(b). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of `teams` and are enrolled in the pension scheme.

<br>

(c). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of `teams`, where their team has a charge cost greater than 80. 
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>  
`charge_cost` may be the wrong type to compare with value `80`. Can you find a way to convert it **without changing** the database? 
</details>
</ul>
<br>

**Question 2.**\
<ul>
(a). Get a table of all `employees` details, together with their `local_account_no` and `local_sort_code`, if they have them.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>  
`local_account_no` and `local_sort_code` are fields in `pay_details`, and employee details are held in `employees`, so this query requires a `JOIN`.
<br><br>
What sort of `JOIN` is needed if we want details of **all** employees, even if they don't have stored `local_account_no` and `local_sort_code`?
</details>

<br>

(b). Amend your query above to also return the `name` of the team that each employee belongs to.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>  
The name of the team is in the `teams` table, so we will need to do another join.
</details>
</ul>
<br>

**Question 3.**\
<ul>
(a). Make a table, which has each employee id along with the team that employee belongs to.

<br>

(b). Breakdown the number of employees in each of the teams.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>   
You will need to add a group by to the table you created above.
</details>

<br>

(c). Order the table above by so that the teams with the least employees come first.
</ul>
<br>

**Question 4.**\
<ul>
(a). Create a table with the team id, team name and the count of the number of employees in each team.

<br>

(b). The `total_day_charge` of a team is defined as the `charge_cost` of the team multiplied by the number of `employees` in the team. Calculate the `total_day_charge` for each team.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary> 
If you `GROUP BY teams.id`, because it's the primary key, you can `SELECT` any other column of `teams` that you want (this is an exception to the rule that normally you can only `SELECT` a column that you `GROUP BY`).
</details>

<br>

(c). How would you amend your query from above to show only those `teams` with a `total_day_charge` greater than 5000?
</ul>
<br>

# Extension 

<br>

**Question 5.**\
How many of the employees serve on one or more committees?  
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary> 
All of the details of membership of committees is held in a single table: `employees_committees`, so this doesn't require a join.
<br><br>
Some employees may serve in multiple committees. Can you find the number of distinct employees who serve? [**Extra hint** - do some research on the `DISTINCT()` function].
</details>

<br>

**Question 6.**\
How many of the employees do not serve on a committee?  
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>   
This requires joining over only two tables
<br><br>
Could you use a join and find rows without a match in the join?
</details>
