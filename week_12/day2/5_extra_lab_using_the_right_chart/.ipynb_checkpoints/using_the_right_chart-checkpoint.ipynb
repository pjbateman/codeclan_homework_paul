    "## 1. Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the goal is to contrast different values between categories or time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naturally points to bar or column charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are great for comparing a small number of quantitative variables between a small number of categories or time points. The bars give a strong and immediate impression of relative size, but people’s ability to process pre-attentive attributes is limited - show too many comparisons and the effect is undermined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are too many points to represent, or too many categories to make comparisons natural, then we typically turn to line graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are particularly suited to time points where the line is naturally suggestive of progression from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "However most line charts become confusing beyond 6-8 lines except in unusual circumstances. In this event, we may need to consider faceting our data over multiple subplots. We haven't covered facetting today but you can find out more about it [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, if our data is naturally cyclical (e.g. angle, months/seasons of the year, etc.) then it’s worth considering a radar plot, although if there are too many time points a bar plot may be easier to read."
