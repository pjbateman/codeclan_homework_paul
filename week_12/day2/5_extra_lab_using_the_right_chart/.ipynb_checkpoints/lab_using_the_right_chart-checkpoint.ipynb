    "\n",
    "If there are too many points to represent, or too many categories to make comparisons natural, then we typically turn to **line graphs**. These are particularly suited to time points where the line is naturally suggestive of progression from left to right. However most line charts become confusing beyond 6-8 lines except in unusual circumstances. In this event, we may need to consider faceting our data over multiple subplots. We haven't covered facetting today but you can find out more about it [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html).\n"
