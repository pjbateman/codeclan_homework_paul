## Data cleaning tips

Here are some pointers for the data cleaning:

* You might find misspellings in the data 
* Outliers - some data might be either too high or too low.
* Some of the data might be the wrong type
* There might be duplicate values
* Be aware that ISO values for countries should always be three characters.
* How are you going to deal with the missing values?

## Analysis questions

Once youâ€™ve cleaned the data here are the analysis questions:

1. What was the greatest disaster of all time by total deaths?
2. Which country has had the highest total people affected by disasters?
3. What are the top 5 countries for total number of disasters?
4. What is the greatest disaster in the last 5 years of the data, by total deaths?
5. What were the top 10 years that had the most people dying from earthquakes?
